## Summary of Key Findings

## Visualizations

## Conclusions

Based on the experimental results:

1. **Representation Drift**: S2 representations gradually drift towards S3
2. **Gradient Imbalance**: S2→S3 gradients dominate over S1→S2
3. **Stability Correlation**: Higher CKA stability correlates with better performance
4. **Critical Mixture Ratio**: ~10% mixture provides stable performance
